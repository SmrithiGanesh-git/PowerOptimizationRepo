# PowerOptimizationRepo
A synchronous mod 10 counter implemented with and without power optimization techniques

The PowerOptimizedReport is a report of the project summary generated by Xilinx Vivado after RTL analysis, Synthesis and Implementation
Two pictures of the power report have been uploaded showing the static and dynamic power consumption before and after the application of power optimization techniques
The corresponding verilog code with and without power optimization has also been added.

There is also a TimingContraint.xdc file to do a timing analysis for the synchronous mod 10 counter, with set up and hold times of 2 ns each.
There is a demo powerGating.upf file to identify behaviour during the power on and off state
