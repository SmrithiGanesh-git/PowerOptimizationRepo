A synchronous mod 10 counter implemented with and without power optimization techniques

The PowerOptimizedReport is a report of the project summary generated by Xilinx Vivado after RTL analysis, Synthesis and Implementation
Two pictures of the power report have been uploaded showing the static and dynamic power consumption before and after the application of power optimization techniques
The corresponding verilog code with and without power optimization has also been added.
